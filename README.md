### Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ares, and I'm a software developer from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm building projects that excite me using different technologies like PHP, Java, and C#. I'm passionate about technology that drives us to a better future.

I'm also learning to become an Ethical Hacker and Machine Learning engineer!
