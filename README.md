### Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

My Github is full of different types of projects. A majority of the projects are Minecraft plugins developed with the Foundation library.
Outisde of these projects I also like to work with PHP and Laravel, as well as Java and Spring Boot.

Of course, I'm always open to new technologies and use the technology that gets the job done.
